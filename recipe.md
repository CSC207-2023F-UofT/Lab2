# Delicious Chocolate Cake Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup hot water
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and ground cinnamon.
3. Add the baking soda, baking powder, and salt, and whisk to combine.
4. Add the eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth.
5. Add the hot water to the batter and mix until combined. The batter will be very thin.
6. Pour the batter into two greased 9-inch (23cm) cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
7. Cool the cakes in their pans on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto the racks and allow to cool completely.
8. While the cakes are cooling, make the ganache. Place the chocolate chips in a medium, heat-proof bowl.
9. In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the heavy cream until it just begins to boil.
10. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips and let sit for 5 minutes, then whisk until smooth.
11. Set the ganache aside to cool for 10-15 minutes, until it has thickened slightly.
12. Place one of the cakes on a cake stand or serving plate. Pour about 1 cup (240 ml) of the ganache over the cake and spread it into an even layer.
13. Place the second cake on top of the ganache and pour the remaining ganache over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides.
14. Allow the ganache to set for 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving.

## Additional Directions by Bob:
4. Add a tablespoon of instant coffee to the dry ingredients for a hint of mocha flavor.
5. Mix in a handful of chocolate chunks for extra indulgence.
6. Line the bottom of the baking pan with parchment paper for easy cake removal.
7. Add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the ganache for a spicy kick.
8. Top with fresh berries for a fruity contrast.
